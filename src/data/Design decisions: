Design decisions:

axios vs native fetch: axios -> better for future of app because it has features like HTTP interceptors for retrying failed requests, easier integration
with automatic JSON data transformation, easy implementation of response timeout

dotenv: use environment variables to determine api endpoints, future might use different endpoints for production vs staging apis

sdk: use the sdk to fetch data instead

inclusion of react-router for url params
